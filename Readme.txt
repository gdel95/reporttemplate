Here are some of the LaTeX templates that I use every day.

Feel free to use them for non-commercial purposes.

Letter with Barcode
--------------------------------------------------
Based on the idea of Stefano: http://stefano.italians.nl/archives/65
Be sure to compile it with XeLaTeX and have texlive-pstricks installed

Report
--------------------------------------------------
Α simple report template. Useful when you are in a hurry.

Report - Greek
--------------------------------------------------
Α simple report template that can be used to write greek with LaTeX. Just go ahead and type your text in greek!
You need to compile the template with XeLaTeX, and you need to have the texlive-full package!!
Based on this article: https://foss.ntua.gr/wiki/index.php/Ελληνικα_στο_TeX/LaTeX_με_το_XeTeX

Flowchart with TikZ
--------------------------------------------------
A simple flowchart using TikZ. The extra files are needed to load the paths.ortho library 
(See here: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/45347/vertical-and-horizontal-lines-in-pgf-tikz)

Beamer slides
--------------------------------------------------
Simple presentation with LaTeX's Beamer class. It's always nice to have a template ready.
It includes item lists, numbered lists, quotes, and figures
Be sure to compile it twice in order to get the sections appear properly!

Beamer slides - Greek
--------------------------------------------------
If you REALLY want to use LaTeX for your presentation, you can write greek slides by using the Babel package.
However you have to write using english characters. It takes a while but after that you'll be good to go. Good luck!
